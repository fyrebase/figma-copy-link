# Figma Copy Link

Have you ever noticed the "Copy Link" functionality when triggered by the shortcut key **`CMD + L`** (`CTRL + L` on Windows) doesn't behave the same way as when right clicking on an element and performing "Copy/Paste as > Copy link"?

You can't copy a link to an Instance or a Component node... only frames :/

This plugin enhances the current "Copy Link" functionality in Figma by allowing you to copy links to Instance and Component nodes just like the right click functionality.

You must enable `enablePrivatePluginApi` within the plugin to allow this functionality to work.

Use [BTT](https://folivora.ai/) or [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on Apple OS to override the default Figma shortcut.
